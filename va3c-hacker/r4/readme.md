[vA3C Hacker R4 ~ 2015-02-12]( ./va3c-hacker-r4.html "The big pivot release" )
===

Welcome to vA3C Hacker R4 - the big-pivot, mobile-enabled, very chatty yet very slim release.

Hacker is now a shadow of its former selves. All that remains is the code required to create this right-side menu.
Any processing duties have been sent off to small standalone scripts - or 'hackettes'.

As that good chairperson once said: "Let a hundred hackettes bloom!" 

The idea is that if you see something you like, all the code that generates that thing is there for the taking with a single 'view source'.

And the menus are written in [Markdown]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ). Just like your Reddit posts. 

So instead of mysterious icons and incomprehensible widgets, you now have ridiculously informative narratives!

All this, and the reasoning behind, will be described in more detail and more demos will be added as time goes by...

We start back at the beginning - a viewer dedicated to the rather gnarly files created during the hackathon that launched this project.

The NASA STL models have a new Hackette release - it isplays random satellites placed randomly - as visible to your left.

Click the three bars at the top left of your screen to pull out the left-side NASA Viewer memu.

If you are on a small screen you may have to click the right-side three bars to hide this menu.
