===

Welcome to vA3C Hacker R4 - the big-pivot, mobile-enabled, very chatty yet very slim release.

Hacker is now a shadow of its former self. All that is left of Hacker is the code required to create this right side menu.
All processing duties have been sent off to the Hackettes.

As that good chairperson once said: "Let a hundred hackettes bloom!" 

Everything is in small standalone apps. 
If you see something you like, all the source code that generated the thing you like is there for the taking with a 'view source code'

The menus are written in Markdown. Just like your Reddit posts. 

Instead of mysterious icons and incomprehensible widgets, you now have ridiculously informative narratives!

New Hackette release. Displays random satellites placed randomly.

Click the three bars at the top left of your screen to pull out the left side menu.

If you are on a small screen you may have to click the right-side three bars to hide this menu.
