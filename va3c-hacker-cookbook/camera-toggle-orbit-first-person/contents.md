When looking at complex 3D models, the Three.js Trackball and Orbit controls do not always satisfy. 
It may be difficult to go 'inside' a particular space and 'look around' - swivel the camera freely.

The usual method is to use a [first person]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games) ) controller.

Three.js offers the First Person control. The control has issues and is not particularly well documented or accompanied by useful examples.

This cookbook section covers a modified version of the Three.js First Person control, provides examples and supplies some instructions.
