* Highly inconsistent behaviors among the menu items

### Notes
2014-12-28 ~ 
The vA3C Hacker Cookbook is for utilities, demos and hacks that use the various vA3C Hacker functions.

vA3C Viewer Cookbook is about small, standalone JavaScript/HTML files. Also the Viewer Cookbook is an earlier effort with a messy organization.
