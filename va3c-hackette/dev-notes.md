* Now at R2
* Add to the read me.

Most of the Hackette work has been going on in actual olders. 
For example see the [NASA 3D Models]( http://va3c.github.io/nasa-samples/browse-nasa-stl-models.html 'Thank you NASA' )

* First pass

Yet another strange day. Started all over again. Even simpler than before.

vA3C Hackette

* An index.html for GitHub repository gh-pages
* Converts markdown to HTML
* Provides a very simple technique for displaying Three.js HTML files as well as JSON, STL, OBJ and other file types

You can write and update a single read me doc that will appear nicely both as GitHUb source code and as HTMKL in gh-pages
The readme doc can serve as a browser or gallery for viewing files and 3D models

Hackette provides only limited viewing functionality. But with a bit of luck, vA3C Hacker will serve as the mother-ship, 
providing extra capabilities and serving as a resource locator for multiple Hackettes
